This C program calculates the shortest distances from a source location to multiple destinations using the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The distance() function computes the Euclidean distance between two latitude-longitude points, while the bellmanFord() function implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest paths from the source node to all other nodes. In main(), the program defines the coordinates of locations, creates all possible edges with their corresponding weights, and calls bellmanFord() to display the shortest distances
